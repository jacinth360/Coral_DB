# CoralDB

**CoralDB** is a relational database designed to integrate and organize phenotypic, ecological, spatial, and genetic data from coral populations across multiple habitats in the Turneffe Atoll Marine Reserve, Belize.  
The database supports longitudinal studies investigating coral adaptation, bleaching susceptibility, and the impact of environmental change.

## Key Features

- Integration of habitat type, geographic coordinates, phenotypic traits (size, color, bleaching status), genetic data (2bRAD sequences), and metagenomic profiles (16S and ITS2).
- SQL-based schema linking coral samples, phenotypes, environmental metadata, and sequencing data.
- Python pipelines for automated data import and preprocessing.
- Support for conservation research questions, including spatial resilience patterns, genetic connectivity, and species-specific adaptation analyses.
- Web-accessible architecture for streamlined querying, visualization, and data retrieval.

## Purpose

**CoralDB** enables marine biologists and conservation scientists to efficiently track coral population dynamics, health metrics, and ecological shifts over time.
